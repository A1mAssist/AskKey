# AGENTS.md

This file is the single source of rules for every agent working in this repository (Codex, Claude, or any other). `CLAUDE.md` only imports it.

## Project

AskKey is a macOS app that stores credentials locally and lets AI agents use them only through a restricted helper (`askkey`) and a local broker inside the app. Each credential has one agent permission: Allow, Ask (default), or Hidden. Agents never receive stored plaintext in broker responses; approved values are delivered to a target process or a short-lived file.

The project started as a fork of [Lokalite](https://github.com/RubenGlez/lokalite) (MIT). It has since diverged substantially; upstream is credited in `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` only.

## Status

v0.1 is normalized and verified on the maintainer's machine (see [#1](https://github.com/sudoHG/AskKey/issues/1)). v0.1.0 ([#100](https://github.com/sudoHG/AskKey/issues/100)), v0.2.0 ([release](https://github.com/sudoHG/AskKey/releases/tag/v0.2.0), [#110](https://github.com/sudoHG/AskKey/issues/110)), v0.3.0 ([release](https://github.com/sudoHG/AskKey/releases/tag/v0.3.0), [#169](https://github.com/sudoHG/AskKey/issues/169)) and v0.3.1 ([release](https://github.com/sudoHG/AskKey/releases/tag/v0.3.1), [#182](https://github.com/sudoHG/AskKey/issues/182)) are released as notarized DMGs; before notarizing, follow the pre-release checks in [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md). In the [client verification receipt](https://github.com/sudoHG/AskKey/issues/91#issuecomment-5975659000), Codex and Cursor passed all five steps; Grok CLI passed steps 1–2, and the maintainer decided not to run steps 3–5 for now.

- All work happens through GitHub Issues and pull requests.
- iCloud backup and recovery were removed from v0.1 in #18. A redesigned backup needs its own issue.
- Supported agent clients are Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and Grok CLI. Multica support was removed in #17; do not reintroduce it.

## Maintainer's agent workflow

This section applies only to agents run by the maintainer. If you are an outside contributor or an agent working for one: use your own Git identity, ignore the roles below, and follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Everything else in this file applies to everyone.

The maintainer's agents follow [docs/agents/issue-workflow.md](docs/agents/issue-workflow.md); the planner also follows [docs/agents/planner.md](docs/agents/planner.md).

| Role | Does | Does not |
|---|---|---|
| Planner (Claude) | Writes task issues, dispatches executors through Orca, reviews PRs, recommends merges | Large implementation work; merging or pushing `main` without the maintainer's approval |
| Reviewer (Codex, separate session) | Stands in for the planner's review when the planner is unavailable; follows `docs/agents/planner.md` review steps | Writing code, pushing to task branches, merging, writing or changing issues' Scope |
| Executor (Codex) | Implements the issue it was dispatched in a dedicated worktree, opens PRs with a receipt, addresses review comments | Merge PRs, push to `main`, change repository settings |
| Maintainer | Makes decisions, approves each merge and each push to `main`, completes `ready-for-human` issues, hands work to executors directly when no planner is running | — |

## Safety boundaries (all agents)

Never, unless an issue labeled `ready-for-human` is being done by the maintainer in person:

- Read or write production data in `~/Library/Application Support/AskKey`. Development namespaces are fine: the `dev` subdirectory `~/Library/Application Support/AskKey/dev` (default for Debug builds and `swift test`), `~/Library/Application Support/AskKey Dev` (used by `make run`), and temporary directories.
- Touch `/Applications/Ask Key.app`, or install anything into `/Applications`.
- Read or write the production keychain service `com.sudohg.askkey.vault`. Development builds use `com.sudohg.askkey.vault.dev`.
- Use real credentials in tests. Use synthetic values only.
- Merge PRs, push or force-push `main`, delete branches or data you did not create, or change repository settings, visibility, label definitions or protection rules. Only the maintainer decides merges; an agent may merge or push `main` only after the maintainer explicitly approves that specific action.
- Push to or modify the archived repository `sudoHG/AskKey-legacy`. Reading it locally as a reference is fine.

## Product identifiers (do not change)

Bundle ID `com.sudohg.askkey.app`, keychain service `com.sudohg.askkey.vault`, data directory `AskKey`, command `askkey`, MCP server name `askkey`, URL scheme `askkey://`, broker protocol version. Official install path is `/Applications/Ask Key.app` with the helper at `Contents/Helpers/askkey`.

Releases follow [ADR 0006](docs/adr/0006-release-process.md): signed and notarized on the maintainer's Mac, and each tag push and publication needs the maintainer's explicit approval. Do not add Sparkle, Homebrew, App Store or CI signing configuration unless an issue asks for it. Never reuse Lokalite's signing team, Sparkle keys or release entries.

## Repository hygiene

- **No process records, and no evidence directories.** Keep logs, screenshots and xcresult bundles only until their results are read, then delete them. The PR description carries the evidence: commands, counts, SHAs and CI links.
- No absolute local paths (`/Users/...`, `/private/var/...`) in committed files. Use `FileManager` temporary directories in tests.
- File and directory names are English.
- Code, comments, docs, ADRs, commit messages, issue and PR titles and PR bodies are written in English, even when an agent's global configuration defaults to another language. Conversation with the maintainer may use any language. User-facing UI strings live in `Localizable.xcstrings` (English and Simplified Chinese).
- Test fixtures, E2E hooks, probes and debug observers do not belong in `Sources/`.
- Source files stay under 600 lines; `Localizable.xcstrings` is exempt.
- No new third-party dependencies without an issue that approves them.

## Build and test

Requirements: macOS 14+, full Xcode with a Swift 6 toolchain, at least 80 GiB free on the data volume.

```bash
swift build
swift test
```

Before pushing a task branch, run locally: `swift build`, the tests for the code you changed (`swift test --filter <Suites>`), and the hygiene and module checks. The full `swift test` suite and the desktop flows run in the PR's CI; a PR is accepted only when both CI jobs are green. Several agents may work in parallel, so do not run the full suite locally unless an issue asks for it.

**Nothing that interrupts the maintainer's desktop runs locally.** Do not launch development or E2E app builds, take screenshots or screen recordings, or drive the UI (AppleScript, System Events, computer use) on the maintainer's Mac unless the maintainer asks for it in that session. Visual evidence comes from CI. When several agents share the maintainer's Mac, at most two may build or test at the same time.

**Desktop UI flows run in CI, not locally.** `bash scripts/run-e2e.sh` drives the real macOS desktop (mouse, keyboard, window focus) for several minutes and blocks the maintainer from using the machine. Agents must not run it locally. The PR's CI `basic-ui-flows` job runs the same required flows on a clean runner and is the E2E acceptance; report its result in the receipt. Run it locally only when an issue explicitly requires it or when a UI failure reproduces only in CI and needs local debugging, and in both cases ask the maintainer first (through Orca, or in the PR when Orca is unavailable) and wait for approval.

Run tests exactly like CI: do not set `ASKKEY_DEBUG_RUN_DIRECTORY`, `ASKKEY_BROKER_SOCKET` or other `ASKKEY_*` variables unless an issue says so. Several tests rely on the default runtime path resolution.

Run the development app only when an issue needs it; it uses the isolated `AskKey Dev` namespace. Never copy a development build to `/Applications/Ask Key.app`.
